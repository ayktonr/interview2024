# Pyspark application for Kommatipara clients

## Code explanation

- As it is required in the exercise.md document, the application takes 3 variables - the paths of the 2 different files and the country information. By only changing the values in those variables, the application can run very flexibly and would not be dependent on specific values. For instance,  data can be filtered out for the Netherlands or United Kingdom separately, or the paths can be different than the one mentioned in the code. 
- Functions have been created to use the same logic multiple times more efficiently.
- Some cleaning activities have been implemented such as dropping unnecessary columns, renaming columns etc.
